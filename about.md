The *Oxford Code Kats* are a small group of coding enthusiasts who meet up on a weekly basis to solve a programming problem known as a *code kata* over a coffee.  It's an opportunity to get a caffeine fix, learn something new and meet other coders all at the same time.

The group is completely open, so anyone is welcome to join. There are no restrictions on programming languages or previous experience.  We do try, as best we can, to follow the practices of *pair programming* and *test driven development*.
